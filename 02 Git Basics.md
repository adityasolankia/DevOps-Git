The linux kernel is an opensource software project of fairy large scope. for most of the lifetime of the linux kernel maintenance(1992-2002), change to the software were passed around as patches and archived files, in 2002, the linux kernel began using a properietary DVCs called bit keeper.

In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the linux kernel and the commercial company that developed Bitkeeper broke down, and the tools free-of-charges status was revoked. prompted the linux development community to develop their own tool based on source of the lessons they learned while using bitkeeper some of the goal of the new system, were as follows: 

  * Speed 
  * Simple design 
  * Strong support for non-linear develop. 
  * Fully distributed
  * Able to handle largest projects like the linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)
